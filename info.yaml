  description: "Real-time ASIC combining order book matching with triple-path anomaly
                detection: rule-based (1-cycle latency), pipelined 16->8->6 MLP neural
                network (4-cycle latency), and a market cascade detector that recognises
                multi-event sequences (volume surge -> flash crash, spoofing -> crash,
                2010 Flash Crash triple pattern) and doubles the circuit breaker freeze
                duration. ML-driven adaptive circuit breaker responds in 2 cycles (40 ns)
                to halt, throttle, or widen spread on the order book. Demonstrates
                parallelism and determinism impossible in software."
